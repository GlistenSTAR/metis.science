## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [derver](https://github.com/alexxnb/derver).
